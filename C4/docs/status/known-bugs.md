# Known bugs

Every open bug in the C4 compiler, runtime, Bedrock and tools. Add an entry when a bug is found;
delete it when the fix lands.

Next ID: **BUG-395**

## Rules for this file

- **One entry per bug.** If one root cause has several symptoms, list them in one entry.
- **IDs are permanent.** Take the "Next ID" above and bump it. Never renumber or reuse an ID, so
  commits, tests and code comments can refer to `BUG-012` safely.
- **Remove the entry when it is fixed**, in the same change as the fix. The fix must come with a test
  that would have caught it (see [../tools/05-test-suites.md](../tools/05-test-suites.md)). Also remove
  the matching "Current implementation" note on the feature's page. The commit message keeps the history.
- **Pre-existing is not a reason to keep a bug.** Per `AGENTS.md`, every known bug gets fixed.
- **Status** is `Open` (confirmed by a repro or by reading the code) or `Needs re-test` (reported
  earlier, may already be fixed; re-test, then fix or delete).
- **Severity:**
  - **High** - miscompiles, memory unsafety, compiler crash, or valid programs that cannot be written.
  - **Medium** - wrong behaviour with a workaround, valid code rejected, a language rule not enforced.
  - **Low** - diagnostics quality, performance, tooling polish.
- Design questions that are not bugs go to [roadmap.md](roadmap.md). Unbuilt features go to the
  roadmap backlog, not here.
